# Reasoning kernel

Sloar's core reasoning loop is deliberately small. Detailed references exist to preserve continuity and handle specialized failure modes, but they must not replace engineering judgment.

Use this kernel for every non-trivial repository change:

```text
OBSERVE -> MODEL -> ACT -> PROVE -> RECONCILE
```

The five moves are semantic, not ceremonial. Small tasks may collapse them into a few actions. Complex tasks may expand a move using the specialized references.

## 1. OBSERVE

Resolve the durable facts that can change the answer:

- exact repository/source identity;
- current behavior and relevant failing evidence;
- available capabilities and actual constraints;
- surviving work that must be preserved.

Do not reconstruct durable facts from conversation memory when the repository, connector, test output, runtime, or checkpoint can answer directly.

Stop observing when additional discovery is unlikely to change the implementation decision. Sloar is not permission for exhaustive repository archaeology.

## 2. MODEL

Build the smallest semantic model that explains the requested behavior.

Identify:

- the authoritative owner of each consequential decision;
- invariants that must remain true;
- independently observable acceptance claims;
- lifecycle/state transitions that can invalidate an in-flight decision;
- the public observable surface: state, return values, promises, callbacks, events, side effects, ordering, counts, artifacts, or rendered behavior.

Prefer domain invariants over file-by-file choreography. Do not add process merely because a reference exists.

### Requirement decomposition

Split a requirement when separate code paths or observables can fail independently. A sentence containing `and`, `or`, multiple lifecycle operations, multiple modalities, or multiple stages is not automatically one evidence claim.

Examples:

```text
logout fencing != explicit invalidation fencing
final state != Promise return value
source build != served first frame
queued cancellation != invocation-boundary cancellation
```

## 3. ACT

Make the smallest coherent structural change that satisfies the model.

Prefer:

- fixing the authoritative owner over downstream compensation;
- one canonical state/model over synchronized duplicates;
- an explicit generation/identity/ownership boundary over timing assumptions;
- preserving existing useful architecture over feature removal used as a workaround.

Do not optimize for minimal line count when a slightly larger coherent change removes a whole class of failure. Do not optimize for maximal defensiveness when the extra machinery does not close a real claim.

## 4. PROVE

Verification attacks the model, not the implementation narrative.

For every consequential claim, ask:

1. What is the strongest observable form of this claim?
2. What transition or boundary is most likely to falsify it?
3. Does the evidence exercise that exact path, phase, identity, and observable?

### Latest-valid-boundary rule

When a claim says an action is valid **before**, **until**, **after**, **during**, or **once** another lifecycle event, do not equate those words with one convenient implementation state.

Find the **latest observable point at which the claim must still hold**, then place the adversarial action there.

Example:

```text
"cancel before runner starts"

weak test:
queued -> cancel

strong boundary test:
slot reserved / invocation scheduled
-> runner not invoked yet
-> cancel all
-> runner invocation count must remain zero
```

An implementation state such as `queued`, `running`, `reserved`, `scheduled`, or `settling` is evidence only if it matches the user-visible semantic phase.

### Transition-adjacent testing

For a required transition `A -> B`, prefer at least one test at the edge immediately adjacent to B when the edge can change correctness. This catches gaps hidden by testing only ordinary A and ordinary B states.

Useful questions:

```text
What work is already reserved but not yet observable?
What callback/microtask/timer is scheduled but not invoked?
What state was detached from dedupe but still owns a resource?
What finalizer can arrive after replacement state exists?
What Promise result can be stale while final storage is correct?
```

### Evidence economy

More tests are not automatically stronger evidence. Prefer a small adversarial basis that covers distinct semantic boundaries. Do not duplicate ten variations of the same phase while leaving one adjacent phase untested.

A PASS claim must name evidence that actually covers the claim. Otherwise use PARTIAL / EVIDENCE_GAP.

## 5. RECONCILE

Before durable publication or completion claims:

- re-resolve mutable remote identity when the write depends on it;
- ensure evidence still targets the bytes/state being published;
- distinguish local verification from remote/runtime convergence;
- preserve a durable checkpoint when work must survive the chat/session;
- report remaining unverified scope instead of converting uncertainty into success.

Reconciliation is where Sloar's continuity and publication machinery expands when needed. It should remain lightweight for local or read-only work.

## Specialized references are conditional expansions

Use a specialized reference only when its trigger is present:

- async/stateful interleavings -> `async-evidence-closure.md`;
- ownership split / production convergence -> `ownership-evidence-closure.md`;
- connector/clone/remote capability mismatch -> `capability-ladder.md`;
- long-turn/stuck-response continuity -> `operational-continuity.md`;
- forge outage/permission/policy -> `forge-resilience.md`;
- Android work -> `android-engineering.md`;
- publication concurrency -> `concurrency.md`.

Do not turn the union of all references into a checklist for every task.

## Stop conditions

The kernel is complete when the requested change is implemented, the relevant claims have matching evidence, publication/recovery state is safe, and no material evidence gap is being hidden.

If new observation no longer changes the model and repeated verification exposes no new failure mechanism, stop. Depth is valuable only while it changes the engineering decision or evidence quality.
